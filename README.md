Introduction

Serialization and deserialization are essential processes in software development for converting object instances into a storable or transmittable format and then restoring them as objects when required. These processes are critical for persisting data, enabling communication between processes, and managing application states effectively.


Benefits

•	Data Persistence- Serialized objects can be stored persistently in files or databases, allowing applications to save and retrieve complex data structures.

•	Interoperability- Serialized data can be transmitted across different platforms and programming languages, enabling seamless communication between systems.

•	State Preservation- Allows objects to maintain their state across different sessions or applications, supporting application continuity.


Mechanism

Serialization involves converting the state of an object into a byte stream, often accomplished by implementing interfaces like Java's Serializable or using custom serialization methods. Deserialization reverses this process, reconstructing objects from the byte stream to restore their original state.

Explanation

1.	Employee Class- This class implements the Serializable interface, which marks it as serializable. It has attributes like name and age.

2.	Serialization-
   
o	In the main method, an Employee object emp is created with name "Sawani Thiwandika" and age 21.

o	The object emp is serialized by writing it to a file named employee.ser. This is done using ObjectOutputStream wrapped around a FileOutputStream.

4.	Deserialization-
   
o	After serialization, the object is deserialized from employee.ser using ObjectInputStream wrapped around a FileInputStream.

o	The deserialized object is cast back to Employee type and assigned to empDeserialized.

6.	Output-

o	If deserialization is successful (empDeserialized is not null), the deserialized Employee object's display method is called to print its attributes.

This example demonstrates the basic process of serializing an object (Employee in this case) into a file and then deserializing it back into an object, preserving its state. This is a foundational concept in Java for persisting and restoring object data.
